            <b>My love for technology</b> is my driving force.<br>
            This is because the world of technology is <i>dynamic and ever-changing</i>,<br> 
            which keeps me on my toes to become a better <b>Software Engineer</b> than I was yesterday.<br>
            I love the constant challenge to study and learn new things always, 
            in order to stay <i>up-to-date</i><br> 
            with the new <b>techniques</b>, <b>programming tools</b> and <b>web applications</b>
            that are coming up <i>everyday</i>.

        <p class="p2">Here is what I have learnt so far and <b>how CSS is important.</b><br>
            <b>CSS</b> means <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i>. It is used for website layout in design and used <i>alongside HTML</i>.<br>
            In other words, CSS is a styling language which helps to control the appearance of a web page (whose structure 
            has been built with HTML code).<br>
            <b>CSS is important</b> to make the website's page <i>look exactly how we want it to look</i>, in terms of
            <i>colors</i>, <i>text sizes</i>, <i>margin</i>, <i>padding</i>, <i>borders</i>, <i>links appearance</i>, 
            <i>hover colors</i>, <i>cursor style</i>,<br> <i>elements positioning</i>, <i>background images</i>, 
            <i>screen sizes display</i>, among many other styling options.

        <p class="p3">Explaining the difference between paddings, margins and borders.<br>
            <b>Padding</b> refers to the <i>inner space between</i> the <i>element content</i> and the <i>element border</i>.<br>
            It is useful to create a <i>breathing-space</i> appearance for the items of HTML elements.<br>
            <b>Margin</b> defines the <i>outer space around elements</i>, on the outside of any defined borders.<br>
            Its Properties include margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left).<br> 
            Negative values are allowed for margin (e.g "margin: -30px auto;").<br>
            <b>Border</b> defines the <i>lines on the four sides</i> (top, right, bottom, left) <i>around an element</i>.<br> 
            It has <i>specific properties</i> (border-style, border-color, border-width and border-radius) which are used 
            to specify the <i>style</i>, <i>color</i> and <i>size</i> of the border of an element.
